Yes, **ASP.NET (both classic ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core)** is designed to handle high concurrency and run **multithreaded** by default. It uses a **thread pool** to manage incoming requests, and each request is handled on a separate thread. The use of `async` methods in an API allows more efficient use of threads in the thread pool, especially during I/O-bound operations.

Here’s how ASP.NET handles requests and uses multithreading:

### 1. **Thread Pool and Request Handling:**
- **Thread Pool**: ASP.NET uses the **ThreadPool** to handle incoming HTTP requests. When a request comes in, ASP.NET assigns it to an available thread from the ThreadPool. The thread processes the request (e.g., executes the controller action) and returns a response.
- **Multithreading**: Since the thread pool can have many threads, ASP.NET can handle multiple requests in parallel. If 1000 requests arrive, the framework will assign threads to as many requests as possible based on the thread pool's size and available threads.

### 2. **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Requests:**
- **Synchronous Methods**: If a request is handled by a **synchronous method**, the thread that handles the request remains occupied until the entire operation (including I/O operations like database or file access) is completed.
- **Asynchronous Methods**: When you use **async** methods (e.g., `async Task<IActionResult>` in ASP.NET Core), the request can release the thread back to the thread pool during any `await` operation (such as awaiting a database query or an external API call). This allows the thread to be used for other requests while waiting for the I/O to complete, thereby improving scalability and performance during high concurrency.

### 3. **How Async Methods Help with Scalability:**
When using **async/await** in an ASP.NET API, the method **does not block the thread** while awaiting I/O operations (like calling a database or an external service). Here’s what happens:
- The thread starts executing the request.
- When the method hits an `await` for an I/O operation (e.g., `await dbQuery()`), the thread is released back to the pool to handle other requests.
- When the I/O operation completes, ASP.NET retrieves an available thread (which might be the same or a different thread) from the pool to continue executing the method after the `await`.

This pattern enables **better scalability**, as threads are not blocked waiting for slow I/O operations. Instead, they can process other requests while awaiting external resources (like databases or web services).

### 4. **Handling a Surge of Requests:**
When there’s a surge in traffic (e.g., 1000 requests), ASP.NET handles it by:
- Allocating requests to available threads in the **ThreadPool**.
- If there are not enough threads, the thread pool may increase the number of threads (within a configured limit) to handle more requests.
- Requests may be queued if no threads are available, but using `async` methods allows ASP.NET to return threads to the pool during waits, making it easier to handle a large number of concurrent requests.

### 5. **Does Using Async Methods Run on the ThreadPool?**
Yes, **async methods in ASP.NET APIs** rely on the **ThreadPool**. However, there are key details to understand:
- The **initial execution** of the request (before any `await`) is handled on a thread from the ThreadPool.
- When the method reaches an `await`, the thread is released, and **no thread is used** during the waiting period (e.g., waiting for a database query).
- Once the awaited operation completes, a thread from the ThreadPool resumes the method after the `await`.

This approach allows ASP.NET to scale efficiently, particularly when handling a high number of requests with many I/O-bound tasks (like database access or HTTP requests to other APIs).

### 6. **ThreadPool and Limits:**
The **ThreadPool** in ASP.NET automatically manages the number of threads based on workload:
- If there’s a sudden spike in traffic (e.g., 1000 requests), the ThreadPool will attempt to increase the number of threads to handle more requests.
- The maximum number of threads is limited by system resources (CPU, memory) and **ThreadPool settings**, but async I/O-bound requests can help by using fewer threads and keeping them available for more work.

### 7. **ThreadPool Starvation:**
If you use synchronous methods or CPU-bound operations extensively without `async/await`, you might face **thread pool starvation**. This happens when all threads are busy (e.g., waiting for I/O), and there are no free threads to handle new incoming requests. Async methods mitigate this by releasing threads during I/O-bound waits.

### Summary:
- ASP.NET uses **multithreading** and a **ThreadPool** to handle requests, allowing it to handle many concurrent requests.
- Using **async methods** allows the efficient use of threads by releasing them during I/O waits, improving scalability and responsiveness during surges of requests.
- Async methods rely on the ThreadPool, but they do not occupy threads while waiting for I/O operations, allowing the server to handle many more concurrent requests compared to synchronous methods.
